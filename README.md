# Playlist_Program
This was my first "real" program I ever made, alone. It was also my final project for Intro to Programming Logic, at Kirkwood Community College.

Yes, there are some bugs. But, I figured I would keep them, not only because I want to show my improvement overtime, but also, I may end up going back and remaking it.
